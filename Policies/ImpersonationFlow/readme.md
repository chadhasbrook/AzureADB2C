# Impersonation Flow for Azure AD B2C
Impersonation flows are common for many business needs. We see this for users that manage other users either through functions within an application or services such as customer support. Whatever the reason may be, it can be easily achieved using Azure AD B2C flexible Identity Experience Framework with a few simple changes. Below are the minimum items required for this scenario. 

## Common Scenarios
1. **Customer Service Representative** requires assisting a user and requires to log into the application on the behalf of the user. The CSR wants to see exactly what the user sees.
2. **Financial Investor** manages on the behalf of their customers. As such, a bank or an investment firm may require these individuals to log into their service/application to manage their customers information.

### Note:
A standard to manage impersonation flows is currently in development and has not been finalized. This sample does not reflect the final product or guidance. You should monitor on this progress and plan to make changes to your design as standards of the industry changes.

# Core Policy components
* 2 Claim Schemas
* 1 Relying Party
* 1 Technical profile
* 1 Validation Technical Profile
* 1 Orchestrated  step


### Claim Schema
* ***targetEmail*** - this string claim represents as a textbox in the UX. This claim to interactive with the privileged user allowing them to pass a value to Azure AD B2C backend service. This value is sent to look up email from **signInNames**.

* ***impersonatedUser*** - this is a string claim that is solely to take the return from the **signInNames** (A collection that contains username & email) and pass it to the application/service. This is done through the Validation Profile **AAD-ImpersonatedUserRead** that pulls the **signInNames.email** variable and pass it to the Relying Party **SignUpOrSignin.xml**.

### Relying Party
* SignUpOrSignin - This is a typical sign-up sign-in policy that adds the varilable ***impersonatedUser*** as an output claim to the application.

### Technical Profile
* SelfAsserted-TargetEmailExchange - This profile prompts user a text box and captures the ***targetEmail***. Within the policy, it triggers the **AAD-ImpersonatedUserRead** Validation Technical Profile to read the user information in the Azure AD B2C directory

### Validation Technical Profile
* AAD-ImpersonatedUserRead - This Validation Technical Profile looks up the user object and returns claims. If user does not exists, it handles a successful error. It returns an output claim ***impersonatedUser*** for the Relying Party **SignUpOrSignin**.
